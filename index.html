          <p>Welcome to neuLayout for Java Swing!</p>
          
          <p>If you would like to read the javadoc for this project: <a href="/dist/javadoc/index.html" > click here</a> </p>

          <p>neuLayout uses Java Swing, and does not use any third party libraries. 
          This application is essentially a 2-dimensional "universe" containing members, all of which extend from the Actor class. 
          The point of this application was to create something where you could visually represent something, anything, in a space larger than your screen or window, 
          and scroll/move around in all four directions to explore the contents of the "universe" outside of what your window currently displays.
          There is a HUD Map which represents the entirety of the universe, and displays it on a much smaller scale, 
          and it also shows your view with respect to the rest of the universe.</p>
