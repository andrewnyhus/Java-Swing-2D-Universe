          <p>Welcome to neuLayout for Java Swing!</p>
          
          <p>If you would like to read the javadoc for this project: <a href="./dist/javadoc/index.html" > click here</a> </p>

          <p>neuLayout uses Java Swing, and does not use any third party libraries. 
          This application is essentially a 2-dimensional "universe" containing members, all of which extend from the Actor class. <br>
          The point of this application was to create something where you could visually represent something, anything, in a space larger than your screen or window, <br>
          and scroll/move around in all four directions to explore the contents of the "universe" outside of what your window currently displays.<br>
          There is a HUD Map which represents the entirety of the universe, and displays it on a much smaller scale, <br>
          and it also shows your view with respect to the rest of the universe.</p>

          Possible Uses:
          <ul>
            <li>Simple 2d game engine.</li>
            <li>Summarizing events within a sports game based on the location they occurred within the field or court (i.e. Basketball game shot summary, Football game tackle/injury summary, etc.)</li>
            <li>Mapping out an area such as a home, building, or even community or city on a basic level.</li>
          </ul>

          Hopes for the future:
          <ul>
            <li>Implement a Connection object which extends Actor and is visually represented as a line between the two actors.</li>
            <li>Support for polygons</li>
            <li>Persistent Storage of ContainerUniverse and SettingsSingleton</li>
            <li>Implementing basic physics (friction, rotation, gravity etc.)</li>
            <li>Have ContainerUniverse extend Actor </li>
            <li>Allowing for storing data within Actor class</li>
            <li>Providing user with ability to add actors on runtime through a menu triggered by a double click (also registering double clicks)</li>
            <li>Doors- optional addons to an actor that act as a portal from the current universe container to a new one that is within that specific actor. Doors are two-sided, so whenever you enter into an actor</li>
            <li>To provide network capabilities.</li>
            <li>To port this to Android.</li>
            <li>To port this to Python for web and for local (Tk for graphics on local version) </li>
          </ul>
